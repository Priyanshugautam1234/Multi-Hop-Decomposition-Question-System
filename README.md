# ðŸ§  Multi-Hop Decompose Question System

The **Multi-Hop Decompose Question System** is an intelligent question answering framework designed to handle **complex, reasoning-based queries** that require combining information from multiple sources or steps.  
It leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **multi-hop reasoning techniques** to decompose a question into smaller sub-questions, find their answers, and synthesize a final, well-reasoned response.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Question Decomposition:** Breaks complex multi-hop questions into manageable sub-questions.
- **Reasoning Chain Generation:** Maintains logical flow and traceability between sub-answers.
- **LLM Integration:** Uses a transformer-based model (e.g., T5, BART, or GPT) for reasoning and answer synthesis.
- **Dataset Support:** Compatible with HotpotQA, QASC, and other multi-hop QA datasets.
- **Explainability:** Provides intermediate reasoning steps to enhance interpretability.

## ðŸ§© System Architecture
1. **Input Question** â†’ User enters a complex natural language question.  
2. **Decomposition Module** â†’ Splits it into relevant sub-questions.  
3. **Sub-Question Answering** â†’ Finds intermediate answers using an LLM or retrieval model.  
4. **Reasoning Module** â†’ Combines sub-answers logically.  
5. **Final Answer Generation** â†’ Synthesizes a coherent, evidence-backed final answer.
